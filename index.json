Such approaches are resource-intensive for participants and staff, challenging during pandemics, and prone to inter- and intra-observer variation. Computer vision algorithms have been proposed to automate the assessment of eczema severity using digital camera images. However, they often require human intervention to detect eczema lesions and cannot automatically assess eczema severity from real-world images in an end-to-end pipeline. We developed a model to detect eczema lesions from images using data augmentation and pixel-level segmentation of eczema lesions on 1345 images provided by dermatologists. We evaluated the quality of the obtained segmentation compared to that of the clinicians, the robustness to varying imaging conditions encountered in real-life images, such as lighting, focus, and blur and the performance of downstream severity prediction when using the detected eczema lesions. The quality and robustness of eczema lesion detection increased by approximately 25% and 40%, respectively, compared to our previous eczema detection model. The performance of the downstream severity prediction remained unchanged. Use of skin segmentation as an alternative to eczema segmentation that requires specialist labelling showed the performance on par with when eczema segmentation is used.

Objective: To investigate within-individual patterns of morbidity of eczema, wheeze and rhinitis from birth to adolescence/early adulthood. **Methods**: We investigated onset/progression/resolution of eczema, wheeze and rhinitis using descriptive statistics, sequence mining and Latent Markov modelling (LMM) in four population-based birth cohorts. We used logistic regression to ascertain if early-life eczema or wheeze, or genetic factors (filaggrin mutations and 17q21 variants), increase the risk of multimorbidity. **Results**: Single conditions, although the most prevalent, were observed significantly less frequently than by chance. There was considerable variation in the timing of onset/remission/persistence/intermittence. Multimorbidity of eczema+wheeze+rhinitis was rare, but significantly over-represented (3-6 times more often than by chance). Although infantile eczema was associated with subsequent multimorbidity, most children with eczema (75.4%) did not progress to any multimorbidity pattern. FLG mutations and rs7216389 were not associated with persistence of eczema/wheeze as single conditions, but both increased the risk of multimorbidity (FLG by 2-3-fold, rs7216389 risk variant by 1.4-1.7-fold). LMM revealed 5 latent states (No disease/low risk; Mainly eczema; Mainly Wheeze; Mainly rhinitis; Multimorbidity). The most likely transition to Multimorbidity was from Eczema state (0.21). However, although this was one of the highest transition probabilities, only 1/5 of those with eczema transitioned to multimorbidity. **Conclusions**: Atopic diseases fit a multimorbidity framework, with no evidence for sequential 'atopic march' progression. The highest transition to multimorbidity was from eczema, but most children with eczema (\u003ethree quarters) had no comorbidities.

Personalised eczema treatment recommendation is of high clinical relevance given the difficulties in predicting heterogeneous treatment responses. **Objective**: We aim to develop a comprehensive model that predicts the patient-dependent dynamic evolution of eczema severity and generates treatment recommendations. **Methods**: We introduced EczemaPred, a computational framework to predict the patient-dependent dynamic evolution of eczema severity using Bayesian state-space models that describe the latent dynamics of eczema severity and measurement errors. We used EczemaPred to predict nine eczema severity items, whose predictions were combined to produce predictions for PO-SCORAD, a validated self-assessed eczema severity score. We further extended EczemaPred to integrate data on treatment usage, estimate treatment effects, and generate treatment recommendations using Bayesian decision analysis. We also improved the quality of the training data by calibrating eczema severity recorded daily by patients with eczema severity assessed monthly by clinicians, and leveraged historical data to kickstart the training of the model and reach more robust conclusions. **Results**: EczemaPred achieved good performance in predicting PO-SCORAD and its severity items daily to weekly, and outperformed standard time-series forecasting models. Estimated treatment responses strongly depended on the patient’s clinical phenotype and allowed us to generate patient-specific treatment recommendations.

AD cannot be cured, but its long-term outcomes can be managed with treatments. Given the heterogeneity in patients’ responses to treatment, designing personalised rather than “one-size-fits-all” treatment strategies is of high clinical relevance. In this thesis, we aim to pave the way towards a data-driven personalised management of AD severity, whereby severity data would be collected automatically from photographs without the need for patients to visit a clinic, be used to predict the evolution of AD severity, and generate personalised treatment recommendations.\nFirst, we developed EczemaNet1, a computer vision pipeline using convolution neural networks that detects areas of AD from photographs and then makes probabilistic assessments of AD severity. EczemaNet was internally validated with a medium-size dataset of images collected in a published clinical trial and demonstrated fair performance.\nThen, we developed models predicting the daily to weekly evolution of AD severity2. We highlighted the challenges of extracting signals from noisy severity data, with small and practically not significant effects of environmental factors3 and biomarkers4 on prediction. We showed the importance of using high-quality measurements of validated and objective (vs subjective) severity scores. We also stressed the importance of modelling individual severity items rather than aggregate scores, and introduced EczemaPred5, a principled approach to predict AD severity using Bayesian state-space models. Our models are flexible by design, interpretable and can quantify uncertainty in measurements, parameters and predictions. The models demonstrated good performance to predict the Patient-Oriented SCOring AD (PO-SCORAD).\nFinally, we generated personalised treatment recommendations using Bayesian decision analysis. We observed that treatment effects and recommendations could be confounded by the clinical phenotype of patients. We also pretrained our model using historical data and combined clinical and self-assessments.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility and the challenges of a data-driven personalised management of AD severity.\nReferences K.

With the expanding role of telemedicine, several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to automatically assess AD severity from digital images. Those algorithms usually detect and then delineate (“segment”) AD lesions before assessing lesional severity, and are trained using the data of AD areas detected by healthcare professionals. To evaluate the reliability of such data, we estimated the inter-rater reliability of AD segmentation in digital images.\nFour dermatologists independently segmented AD lesions in 80 digital images collected in a published clinical trial. We estimated the inter-rater reliability of the AD segmentation using the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) at the pixel-level and the area-levels for different resolutions of the images. The average ICC was 0.45 (SE=0.04) corresponding to a “poor” agreement between raters, while the degree of agreement for AD segmentation varied from image to image.\nThe AD segmentation in digital images is highly rater-dependent even between dermatologists. Such limitations need to be taken into consideration when the AD segmentation data are used to train machine learning algorithms that assess eczema severity.

We have recently developed computational tools that facilitate a data-driven approach towards patient-centered care for AD by an “assess”, “predict” and “act” strategy. The first tool, EczemaNet, is a computer vision pipeline using deep learning to assess AD severity from photographic images. EczemaNet could accurately predict the intensity of seven disease signs for each image, after training on 1393 images from 310 AD children. Automatic evaluation of AD severity by EczemaNet could help patients to monitor their AD conditions more easily at home without attending clinics. The second tool, EczemaPred, is a computational package to develop statistical machine learning predictive models for any AD severity scores. EczemaPred uses longitudinal data to train Bayesian state-space models that predict each severity item constituting severity scores, and can deal with missing or irregular measurements, or data from a small population. We developed personalised predictive models for two patient-oriented AD severity scores, daily PO-SCORAD and weekly POEM, using EczemaPred and three different longitudinal datasets from more than 600 patients in total. Predicting temporal evolution of AD severity scores at an individual level, under different treatment regimens, could inform the design of personalised treatment strategies that the patients can act on. Our analysis found little evidence that additional factors (such as biomarkers and environmental factors) improve the prediction performance significantly.
